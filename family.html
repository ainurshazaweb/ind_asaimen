<p><h1 style="font-family: Habo Std; font-size: 20px;"> Time spent together creates memories. Life is meant to be shared with those you love. A family is there for each other- Always! Nothing is too great for us to tackle together. We may not choose the family we're born into, but we can choose to be a close-knit family.

“You fathers will understand. You have a little girl. She looks up to you. You’re her oracle. You’re her hero. And then the day comes when she gets her first permanent wave and goes to her first real party, and from that day on, you’re in a constant state of panic.” – Stanley T. Banks
